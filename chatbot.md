Building my portfolio chatbot powered by GPT-4. 
Structured plan:

Phase 1: Project Scoping and Planning (TPM Focus)

Define Goals and Objectives:

What do you want the chatbot to achieve? (Answer questions, guide users, showcase projects, etc.)
What are your success metrics? (User engagement, time spent on the site, number of questions answered)
What are the constraints? (Budget, timeline, technical expertise)
Identify Key Features:

Which sections of your portfolio should the chatbot focus on? (Projects, skills, experience, education, etc.)
What types of questions should it be able to answer? (Factual, opinion-based, open-ended)
Should it have additional capabilities? (Small talk, recommendations, job application assistance)
Create a Project Timeline:

Break down the project into manageable tasks.
Estimate timelines for each task, considering dependencies.
Set milestones for progress review.
Assemble Resources:

Determine if you'll be working alone or collaborating with others.
Identify the necessary tools and technologies (GPT-4 API, chatbot framework, website scraper, database).
Allocate budget for API usage, hosting, and any potential third-party services.
Phase 2: Technical Implementation (Technical Focus)

Data Collection and Preparation:

Extract information from your portfolio website.
Structure the data (project descriptions, skills, experience, etc.) in a way that's easily accessible to the chatbot.
Store the data in a database or as structured files.
Chatbot Framework Setup:

Choose a framework like Rasa or LangChain that supports GPT-4 integration.
Set up the framework to interact with your data and the GPT-4 API.
Design the conversational flow (intents, entities, dialogs).
Prompt Engineering:

Craft prompts that provide context and guide the GPT-4 model to generate accurate and relevant responses.
Create different prompt templates for various question types (factual, opinion-based, etc.).
Response Filtering and Validation:

Implement mechanisms to filter out irrelevant or inaccurate responses from the GPT-4 model.
Validate factual information against your portfolio data.
Ensure responses are appropriate and aligned with your brand voice.
Integration with Website:

Embed the chatbot on your portfolio website using a chat widget or pop-up.
Test the integration thoroughly to ensure seamless communication.
Phase 3: Testing, Iteration, and Deployment (TPM and Technical Focus)

User Testing:

Gather feedback from friends, colleagues, or potential users to identify areas for improvement.
Test the chatbot's ability to understand different phrasings of questions and provide accurate answers.
Iteration and Refinement:

Refine the NLU model, conversation flow, prompt templates, and response filters based on user feedback.
Continuously improve the chatbot's accuracy and responsiveness.
Deployment:

Deploy the chatbot to your portfolio website.
Monitor its performance and usage statistics.
Regularly update the data and model to keep the information current.
TPM Considerations Throughout:

Risk Management: Continuously assess and mitigate risks (data breaches, model bias, downtime).
Stakeholder Management: Communicate progress and challenges to yourself (as the "client") and any collaborators.
Adaptability: Be prepared to adjust plans and timelines as needed based on user feedback and unexpected challenges.
Additional Tips:

Start Small: Begin with a limited scope and gradually expand the chatbot's capabilities.
Leverage Existing Resources: Utilize pre-built components and libraries whenever possible.
Document Everything: Keep detailed records of your decisions, code, and learnings for future reference and improvement.
